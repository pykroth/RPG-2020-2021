FireExplosion_1 is setup for about a radius 2.0 explosion effect.

Particle Systems on each GameObject:

FireExplosion_1: Wavey flame.
	Start Size: 4 (set to radius*2)

Shock: Horizontal Sparkle, very fast to disappear
	Start Size: 2 (radius) to 3 (radius*1.5f)

Cloud: Orange explosion circles, big part of the explosion effect
	Start Size: 3 (radius*1.5f) to 4 (radius*2.0f)
	You can play around with the start size more on this.

Cloud_2: Red smoke circle, big part of the explosion effect
	Start Size: 4 (radius*2.0f) to 5 (radius*2.5f)
	Should be slightly larger than the first Cloud because it's a softer effect.

Particle: Small Sparks from center
	Start Size: is a curve, 0.05 to 0.20.  Wouldn't change this very much.
	Max Particles: 20 can increase for bigger aoes
	Emission: Bursts Count: 20 increase if you increase max particles
	Veloicty over Lifetime: Speed Modifier: 1.5 (about radius*.75f)
